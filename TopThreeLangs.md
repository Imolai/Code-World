# What are the top 3 languages that (will) dominate the present (and the future)

## Context

The charts in the GitHub [Octoverse 2024](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/) report clearly show which languages are at the forefront of development trends and which ones will continue to dominate in the future. Three key graphs are used for this analysis:

1. ![Top programming languages on GitHub](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GitHub-Octoverse-2024-top-programming-languages.png?w=600)
2. ![Top 10 fastest growing programming languages in 2024](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GitHub-Octoverse-2024-fastest-growing-programming-languages.png?w=600)

When these data are put together, it is clear that Python, TypeScript, and Go dominate both current and future technological developments. This is especially true for backend development, where these languages are becoming increasingly dominant.

Why not Java, C#, or C++? Let's investigate.

## Why Python, TypeScript and Go

### 1. Python

- **So versatile**: Python is a staple in data science, machine learning, automation and web development.
- **Quick to develop in**: Its simple syntax and extensive library accelerate the development process.
- **Batteries included**: Lots of libraries, frameworks, e.g. Django and Flask provide stability and flexibility for projects of any size.
- **The flagship of AI development**: The rise of AI continues to strengthen its position, as confirmed by Octoverse data.

### 2. TypeScript

- **Successor to modern JavaScript**: TypeScript offers all the benefits of JavaScript, with the addition of static type checking; improved code organization; better code completion in IDEs making larger projects more reliable.
- **Fullstack language**: You can use the same language for frontend and backend development, especially with e.g. Node.js and NestJS.
- **Current**: According to GitHub, TypeScript is one of the fastest growing languages, thanks to modern development needs.

### 3. Go

- **Easy and fast**: Its minimalist syntax makes it quick to learn while enabling the development of high-performance systems.
- **Really parallel**: Go's native goroutines simplify the development of scalable, parallel systems.
- **Built for modern domains**: Go is an ideal choice for microservices, containerization (e.g. Kubernetes, Docker), and low-latency systems.

## Why not Java, C#, or C++

### 1. Java

- **Legacy dominance**: While still popular in the enterprise ecosystem, new projects often choose more modern alternatives such as Kotlin, Python, or Go.
- **Complexity**: Java's over-complexity makes it less attractive to teams looking for simpler and faster solutions.

### 2. C#

- **Platform Specificity**: Popular primarily in the Windows and Azure ecosystem, which limits its global applicability.
- **Less community support**: C# is increasingly emerging as a niche language, while Python and TypeScript are more universally usable.

### 3. C++

- **Complex development**: Due to memory management and maintenance challenges, many projects prefer more modern alternatives such as *Rust*.
- **Slow and fragile compilation**: C++ build systems (e.g. *CMake*) and compilation environments are non-standardized, often unstable, and require considerable experience. Large projects are extremely slow to compile, and this takes significant development time, which is costly for customers. Gaps in tooling and dependency management (e.g. *Conan*) can be a major challenge in modern development processes.
- **Niche applications**: C++ remains relevant for embedded systems and game development, but is not typical for general backend use.

## Why the top 3 are worth considering

1. **The market dictates**: GitHub statistics and trends clearly show that Python, TypeScript and Go are the fastest growing backend languages.
2. **Efficiency**: Faster development time and easier learning, while providing flexibility and future-proofing.
3. **Versatility**: Python can be used for everything from AI to web development, TypeScript focuses on full stack solutions, while Go is the champion of scalable systems.
4. **Community support**: These languages have a vibrant community and an ever-expanding ecosystem.

## Closing words

Whether to engage or become engaged in a newer, more modern, more popular tech stack embodying programming language should not be an either-or decision. It doesn't mean we have to throw away a language or stack that we've invested a lot in, that is our favourite.
But in IT, we cannot afford to stop lifelong learning, closing ourselves off to new technology. We don't need to know everything, we don't need to master everything from A to Z straight away, we can just understand areas at an overview level and know when and where to go deeper. This little reflection is only intended to indicate one (or rather three :) possible directions for this.
